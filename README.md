TrackingMe
=======

TrackingMe is a simple iOS app written in Swift which tracks multiple moving locations at the same time.
It allows users to see each other on the map, so users can realize the relative postions on the map.

This demo site utilizes techniques as follows:

- Firebase realtime database as back end.
- MapKit

Note: the "GoogleService-Info.plist" which contains confidential data is not included.
